## Project Description:
Obsidion is a cross platform 3D game engine written in C++.
Its main focus is on providing a lightweight, efficient, and flexible engine for game developers.
Currently, it offers features such as GLTF and OBJ model loading, 2D sprite rendering, input system, android support, 3D perspective camera, 2D orthographic camera, font rendering, and more.

Obsidion provides a cross platform API for fast prototyping of 2D/3D Games and simulations. It is a great framework for game makers who enjoy coding.
It is also great for learning C++ while creating cool visuals.
