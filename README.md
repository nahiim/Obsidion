## Project Description:
Obsidion is a cross platform 3D game engine written in C++.
Its main focus is on providing a lightweight, efficient, and flexible framework for game developers.
Currently, it is available on Windows and Linux, and deployable to android.

Obsidion provides a cross platform API for fast prototyping of 2D/3D Games and simulations. It is a suitable framework for game makers who enjoy coding.
It is also convenient for learning C++ and game programming while creating cool visuals.
