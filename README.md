There are examples and sample code to help developers get started with using the engine.

## Documentation:
The [wiki](https://github.com/xploor-games/Obsidion/wiki) includes a detailed guide to the engine's architecture, code structure, and functionality.
It provides information on how to use each feature of the engine, as well as best practices for game development using Obsidion.
